# FastMM4CPP
Use FastMM for memory management in CPlusPlus

FastMM, as you may known, is a very great memory management project for Delphi/C++Builder(although it's not as FAST 
in (heavy) multi threaded situations as in single thread situations by now), but it can not be used directly in 
Visual C++, and that's the reason why this repo's created.

P.S: TCMALLOC is great too but, it's not a bad idea to try FASTMM in the CPP world:)
